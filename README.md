A complementary repository for the dissertation of the same name by Kirushanth Srithararajah
_____

This repo contains both a Jupyter Notebook of the exploration discussed in the paper and a collection of algorithms from the NIST Statistical Testing Suite (full credit for the Python code this goes to the orignal author https://github.com/stevenang/randomness_testsuite; some minor changes have been made to make it useable in a notebook environment).
