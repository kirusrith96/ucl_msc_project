# Generating Uniform Random Variables from Atmospheric Noise
A complementary repository for the dissertation of the same name by UCL Student 15012534 (note that anonymity will be preserved until grading is complete)
_____

This repo contains:
- `report.pdf` (the full paper)
- `cirarra.py` (a library to generate true random numbers)
- `notebook.ipynb` (a Jupyter Notebook of the exploration discussed in the paper) 
- `nist.py` (a collection of algorithms from the NIST Statistical Testing Suite
- `requirements.txt` (a set of required packages and their versions)
- `cirarra_test.ipynb` (a notebook that shows how to use `cirarra`)
- `data/..` (a folder with some pre-sampled IQ data so the user can run the notebook straight away)

Full credit for the code in `nist.py` goes to the orignal author [Steven Kho Ang](https://github.com/stevenang/randomness_testsuite); although some minor changes have been made to make it useable in a notebook environment.


The word "cirarra" (சீரற்ற) means random in Tamil.
