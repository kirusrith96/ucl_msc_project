# Generating Uniform Random Variables from Atmospheric Noise
A complementary repository for the dissertation of the same name by Kirushanth Srithararajah
_____

This repo contains:
- paper.pdf (a report on this whole project; as part of UCL Masters Thesis by UCL Student 15012534)
- cirarra.py (a library to generate true random numbers)
- cirarra_test.ipynb (a notebook that shows how to use `cirarra`)
- notebook.ipynb (a Jupyter Notebook of the exploration discussed in the paper) and a collection of algorithms from the NIST Statistical Testing Suite (full credit for the Python code goes to the orignal author [Steven Kho Ang](https://github.com/stevenang/randomness_testsuite); some minor changes have been made to make it useable in a notebook environment).
