# Generating Uniform Random Variables from Atmospheric Noise
A complementary repository for the dissertation of the same name by UCL Student 15012534 (note that anonymity will be preserved until grading is complete)
_____

This repo contains:
- paper.pdf (the full dissertation report)
- cirarra.py (a library to generate true random numbers)
- cirarra_test.ipynb (a notebook that shows how to use `cirarra`)
- notebook.ipynb (a Jupyter Notebook of the exploration discussed in the paper) 
- nist.py (a collection of algorithms from the NIST Statistical Testing Suite

Full credit for the code in `nist.py` goes to the orignal author [Steven Kho Ang](https://github.com/stevenang/randomness_testsuite); some minor changes have been made to make it useable in a notebook environment).


The word "cirarra" (சீரற்ற) means random in Tamil.
